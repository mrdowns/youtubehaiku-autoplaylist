When watching videos on /r/youtubehaiku, I had a few minor problems:
 - I don't want these videos to affect my recommended videos in Youtube
 - I don't want to pore through every video that doesn't have a lot of upvotes
 - I want streamline the process of watching the videos I haven't seen

This chrome extension:
 - Looks for videos in your current Reddit tab from /r/youtubehaiku that have 100 pts or more
 - Creates a Youtube playlist from them
 - Opens the playlist in an incognito window

TODO:
 - Only add unwatched videos to the playlist
 - Ability to configure point threshold
